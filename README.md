Remember to take your time and work through each question diligently! Test your code, make sure it works, and try to find ways to improve. Once you are happy and satisfied with your code, upload it to Github, then turn in your Github link at the bottom of the page!

Don't forget. Make sure this assignment is in it's own repository. Not mixed in with others!

In this PokeAPI Integration project, you'll develop a web application that seamlessly integrates with the PokeAPI, providing users with an immersive experience into the world of Pokémon. Leveraging HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript, you'll create a dynamic and interactive platform for exploring Pokémon data and information.

Project Requirements

Homepage:
Design a visually appealing landing page with Bootstrap components and custom CSS styles.
Implement responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
Pokémon Search Page:
Create a search page where users can enter a Pokémon's name or ID to retrieve relevant information.
Utilize JavaScript to fetch data from the PokeAPI and dynamically update the webpage content based on user input.
Pokémon Details Page:
Develop a details page that displays comprehensive information about a specific Pokémon, including its abilities, types, stats, and image.
Apply CSS styling to enhance the presentation of Pokémon details and ensure readability.
Pokémon Types Page  (Bonus):
Create a page that categorizes Pokémon based on their types (e.g., grass, fire, water) and allows users to explore Pokémon within each type category.
Apply CSS styles to differentiate Pokémon types and enhance visual clarity.
Pokémon Abilities Page  (Bonus):
Develop a page that lists different Pokémon abilities and provides detailed descriptions for each ability.
Utilize JavaScript to fetch ability data from the PokeAPI and present it in a user-friendly format.
Pokémon Moves Page  (Bonus):
Design a page that showcases various Pokémon moves, including their names, types, power, accuracy, and effects.
Apply CSS styles to organize move data and create an intuitive user interface for browsing moves.
Pokémon Generation Page  (Bonus):
Implement a page that displays Pokémon from specific generations (e.g., Generation I, Generation II) and allows users to explore Pokémon within each generation.
Utilize JavaScript to filter and display Pokémon based on generation criteria.
Pokémon Team Builder (Bonus):
Create a team builder feature that allows users to assemble and customize their Pokémon teams.
Implement drag-and-drop functionality or interactive forms for adding and removing Pokémon from the team.
Pokémon Battle Simulator (Bonus):
Develop a Pokémon battle simulator that simulates Pokémon battles based on user-selected teams and moves.
Utilize JavaScript to simulate battle mechanics, calculate damage, and determine battle outcomes.
GitHub Repository:
Maintain a clean and interactive README.md file in the GitHub repository, providing clear instructions on how to run the application and explanations of its features.
Include a link to the GitHub repository in the project documentation.
Submission

Upon completing the project, submit your code and video, including all source code files, and the README.md file in your GitHub repository to your instructor or designated platform.
NOTE: Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your HTML file that is linked to your JavaScript file, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements, console.logs, or for loops, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected. If you have a function, make sure the function is called and runs. If there are classes/objects, make sure they are instantiated and the methods are called.
